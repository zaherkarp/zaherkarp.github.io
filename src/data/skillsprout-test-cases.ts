/**
 * Comprehensive test cases for the SkillSprout career trajectory engine.
 *
 * Now uses the full O*NET 28.3 database (1,016 occupations) with canonical
 * O*NET skill and knowledge names.
 *
 * Organized around themes from Anthropic's "The Macroeconomic Impact of
 * Artificial Intelligence" (2025), which uses O*NET task and skill data to
 * model AI-driven labor market transitions:
 *
 *   1. AI-adjacent upskilling
 *   2. Cross-domain pivots
 *   3. Declining-role escape paths
 *   4. Trades-to-tech transitions
 *   5. Long-term reskill with significant zone jumps
 *   6. Iterative refinement (multi-turn API sessions)
 *   7. Edge cases
 *   8. Anthropic paper-specific scenarios
 *   9. Healthcare transitions
 *  10. Full-dataset coverage (any-occupation searches)
