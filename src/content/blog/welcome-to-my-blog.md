Welcome to my blog! This is a space where I'll share thoughts on healthcare analytics, data engineering, and the intersection of technology and healthcare.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about various topics including:

- **Healthcare Analytics**: Insights from working with electronic health records, population health data, and clinical analytics
- **Data Engineering**: Best practices, tools, and techniques for building robust data pipelines
- **SQL & Python**: Tips, tricks, and solutions to common problems
- **Industry Reflections**: Observations about the healthcare technology landscape

## Why I'm Writing

Throughout my career, I've encountered numerous challenges and learned valuable lessons working with healthcare data. This blog serves as a way to:

1. Document solutions to problems I've solved
2. Share knowledge with the healthcare analytics community
3. Reflect on industry trends and developments
4. Connect with others in the field

## Technical Setup

This blog is built using:

- **Astro**: A modern static site generator
- **Markdown**: For simple, focused writing
- **Tufte CSS**: Inspired typography for readable, elegant content

The minimalist design is intentional—it puts the focus squarely on the content, following Edward Tufte's principle of maximizing the data-to-ink ratio.
