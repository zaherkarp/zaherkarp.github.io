## Project Overview

During my time as a graduate student, I had the opportunity to lead a comprehensive research study investigating how physical clinic environments influence team interactions in family medicine settings. This project combined my interests in healthcare quality, human factors, and statistical analysis.

## Securing Funding

One of the most rewarding aspects of this project was successfully writing a grant proposal that secured $18,000 in funding. The grant writing process taught me how to:

- Clearly articulate research objectives and hypotheses
- Justify methodology and resource allocation
- Communicate the potential impact of research findings
- Navigate the administrative requirements of institutional funding

## Research Methodology

This was a true mixed-methods study, combining both qualitative observations and quantitative analysis:

### Qualitative Component

- **120 hours of direct observations** in family medicine clinics
- **9 focus groups** with 40 healthcare providers and staff
- Systematic coding and analysis of interaction patterns
- Documentation of environmental factors affecting workflow

### Quantitative Analysis

- Statistical analysis using SAS
- Measurement of communication frequency and quality
- Assessment of efficiency metrics
- Privacy perception surveys

## Key Findings

The research revealed several important insights about how clinic design affects healthcare delivery:

1. **Communication Patterns**: Open versus closed workspace designs significantly affected how often and how effectively team members communicated
2. **Efficiency Trade-offs**: Some design elements that improved privacy sometimes reduced operational efficiency
3. **Team Satisfaction**: Environmental factors had measurable effects on staff satisfaction and perceived quality of care

## IRB Protocol & Ethics

Navigating the Institutional Review Board (IRB) process was an essential part of this research. I developed protocols for:

- Informed consent procedures
- Confidentiality protections for participants
- Data security and storage
- Ethical observation methods

## Publication & Impact

The research culminated in peer-reviewed publication, allowing the findings to reach a wider audience of healthcare administrators, architects, and policy makers. The study has been cited in discussions about evidence-based clinic design.

## Skills Developed

This project was instrumental in developing my capabilities in:

- Mixed-methods research design
- Qualitative data collection and analysis
- Statistical programming in SAS
- Academic writing and publication
- Grant proposal development
- Project management and timeline execution
- IRB protocol development

## Reflections

Looking back, this project exemplified the importance of rigorous research methodology in understanding complex healthcare systems. The ability to combine observational insights with statistical rigor allowed us to make evidence-based recommendations that could actually improve patient care environments.

The experience also reinforced my belief that healthcare analytics isn't just about numbers—it's about understanding the human experiences and workflows that those numbers represent.
