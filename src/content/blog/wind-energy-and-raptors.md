A new organization is working to balance wind energy expansion with protection for birds of prey. Dr. Judd Howell, the inaugural Research Director at the American Wind and Wildlife Institute (AWWI), brings expertise in both wind energy impacts and raptor conservation from his previous work in the Altiplano region.

## The Challenge

Raptors face particular vulnerability since they exist in smaller populations than other bird species. As Howell noted: "Birds fly into things." Beyond wind turbines, human infrastructure like "buildings, automobiles and power lines" poses similar hazards.

### Why Raptors Are Vulnerable

**Population Characteristics**
- Slow reproductive rates
- Long maturation periods
- Small population sizes
- Specialized habitat needs
- Sensitivity to disturbance

**Behavioral Factors**
- Hunting behavior brings them into rotor zones
- Soaring flight patterns intersect turbine heights
- Visual focus on prey rather than obstacles
- Territorial defense can ignore hazards
- Migration routes through wind development areas

## Case Study: Altamont Pass

California's Altamont Pass Wind Farm, among the world's oldest and largest, illustrates the problem. A 2005 report documented between 1,870 to 4,310 annual bird deaths across 31 species.

### Altamont's Unique Challenges

Howell emphasized the facility lacked adequate planning, developed hastily during the 1970s energy crisis using smaller, less efficient turbines than modern installations.

**Historical Context**
- Built during oil crisis with limited environmental review
- Thousands of small turbines on lattice towers
- Sited in prime raptor habitat
- No wildlife assessment conducted
- Turbine density extremely high

**Why Altamont Is Particularly Problematic**
- Located in important raptor migration corridor
- Rich prey base attracting birds of prey
- Older turbine design more dangerous
- Lattice towers provide perching opportunities
- Blade speeds creating strike hazards

### Species Affected

The impact fell disproportionately on protected species:
- **Golden eagles**: Significant population impact
- **Red-tailed hawks**: High mortality numbers
- **American kestrels**: Widespread fatalities
- **Burrowing owls**: Ground-dwelling vulnerability

## Mitigation Strategies

Recent efforts show promise through various approaches:

### Turbine Shutdowns

Iberdrola Renewables reduced bat mortality by 53-87% through selective nighttime shutdowns during low-wind conditions.

**How It Works**
- Identifies high-risk periods (low wind, specific seasons)
- Temporarily stops turbines during these windows
- Minimal energy production loss
- Significant wildlife benefit

**Applicability to Raptors**
- Similar approach could protect during migration
- Shutdown during peak hunting hours
- Seasonal adjustments for breeding
- Weather-based protocols

### Visual Deterrents

Blade painting experiments have shown potential but remain unimplemented at scale.

**Theoretical Benefits**
- Increase turbine visibility to birds
- Break up motion blur
- Provide visual warning
- Low-cost intervention

**Implementation Barriers**
- Uncertain effectiveness
- Aesthetic concerns
- Maintenance requirements
- Lack of large-scale validation

### Site Selection

Proper location assessment represents the most critical prevention factor.

**Best Practices**
- Comprehensive wildlife surveys before development
- Multi-year data collection on species presence
- Migration corridor identification
- Habitat assessment
- Population modeling

**Avoidance Criteria**
- Known raptor nesting areas
- Critical hunting habitat
- Migration concentration points
- Endangered species territories
- High-value conservation areas

## Modern Turbine Design Advantages

Newer wind facilities differ significantly from Altamont:

### Technological Improvements

**Fewer, Larger Turbines**
- Higher capacity per unit
- Greater spacing between turbines
- Taller towers keeping blades higher
- Smoother towers preventing perching

**Safety Features**
- Slower rotational speeds
- Better bird detection systems
- Automated shutdown capabilities
- Tubular rather than lattice towers

### Siting Improvements

Modern projects incorporate:
- Pre-construction wildlife studies
- Migration pattern analysis
- Habitat modeling
- Population impact assessment
- Stakeholder engagement

## The AWWI Model

The American Wind and Wildlife Institute brings together conservation groups, industry, and NGOs to develop proactive solutions while advancing renewable energy infrastructure responsibly.

### Collaborative Approach

**Stakeholder Inclusion**
- Environmental organizations
- Wind energy developers
- Government agencies
- Research institutions
- Local communities

**Benefits of Collaboration**
- Shared knowledge and expertise

## Broader Wildlife Considerations

While raptors receive significant attention, wind facilities affect other species:

### Bats

- High mortality rates at many facilities
- Different mitigation strategies needed
- Less visible but significant impact
- Ecosystem role in pest control

### Migratory Birds

- Seasonal mortality spikes
- Species-specific vulnerabilities
- Cumulative impact across facilities
- Coordination with migration patterns

### Local Species

- Habitat fragmentation from development
- Construction disturbance
- Noise impacts on breeding
- Changes in prey availability

## Balancing Energy and Conservation

The fundamental challenge involves advancing clean energy while protecting wildlife:

### The Climate Imperative

- **Renewable energy necessity**: Climate change threatens all species
- **Carbon reduction urgency**: Fossil fuel alternatives needed
- **Ecosystem disruption**: Climate impacts exceed turbine impacts
- **Transition speed**: Quick deployment required

### Conservation Priorities

- **Population viability**: Maintaining healthy wildlife populations
- **Rare species protection**: Special concern for threatened species
- **Ecosystem function**: Preserving ecological relationships
- **Ethical responsibility**: Minimizing human-caused mortality

## Solutions Framework

Effective approaches require:

### Preventive Measures

1. **Smart siting**: Avoid high-risk areas
2. **Pre-construction assessment**: Understand risks before building
3. **Design optimization**: Use safest turbine configurations
4. **Capacity concentration**: Fewer sites with larger capacity

### Operational Modifications
