## Introduction to Accountable Care Organizations

The **Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP)** represents one of Medicare's largest experiments in value-based care. Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) agree to take responsibility for the quality and cost of care for their attributed Medicare beneficiaries, with the opportunity to share in savings if they reduce costs while maintaining quality.

This research investigated a critical question: **Does the amount an ACO saves depend on where they started?** Specifically, we examined whether baseline spending levels predict shared savings performance.

## The Research Question

### Why This Matters

Understanding the relationship between baseline expenditures and savings potential has major policy implications:

1. **Fair Benchmarking**: Are current benchmarking methods fair to ACOs with different starting points?
2. **Selection Effects**: Do ACOs serving different populations face different savings opportunities?
3. **Payment Policy**: Should the program account for baseline spending in reward calculations?
4. **Program Sustainability**: Can high-cost and low-cost regions both achieve savings?

### Hypothesis

We hypothesized that ACOs with higher baseline expenditures might have more "low-hanging fruit" for cost reduction, potentially leading to greater absolute savings. Conversely, efficient ACOs starting with low baseline costs might find it harder to generate additional savings.

## Data Sources

### Medicare Administrative Data

We utilized several Medicare data sources:

- **ACO Public Use Files**: Performance metrics, savings, and quality scores
- **Geographic Practice Cost Indices**: To adjust for regional cost differences
- **Beneficiary Attribution Files**: To understand ACO patient populations
- **Quality Reporting**: To ensure savings weren't achieved through quality reductions

### Variables of Interest

**Dependent Variable:**
- Net savings (or losses) generated by ACOs
- Binary indicator of achieving shared savings

**Independent Variables:**
- Baseline per-beneficiary expenditures
- ACO characteristics (size, rural/urban, provider composition)
- Market characteristics (Medicare Advantage penetration, competition)
- Quality performance scores

## Statistical Methodology

### Data Preparation in Stata

Extensive data wrangling was required:

```stata
* Merge multiple years of ACO data
use "mssp_2014.dta", clear
append using "mssp_2015.dta"
append using "mssp_2016.dta"

* Calculate baseline expenditures
bysort aco_id: egen baseline_exp = mean(exp) if year == baseline_year

* Adjust for regional cost differences
gen adj_exp = expenditures / geographic_index
```

### Regression Modeling

We employed multiple regression specifications:

#### Linear Regression
```stata
regress net_savings baseline_expenditures aco_size rural quality_score, robust
```

#### Logistic Regression
For binary outcomes (achieved savings vs. not):
```stata
logit achieved_savings baseline_expenditures controls, robust
```

#### Quantile Regression
To examine effects across the distribution of savings:
```stata
qreg net_savings baseline_expenditures controls, quantile(0.5)
```

### Addressing Endogeneity

A key methodological challenge: baseline expenditures aren't randomly assigned

**Potential Confounders:**
- Patient population health status
- Regional practice patterns
- Provider specialty mix
- Social determinants of health

**Solutions:**
- Included rich set of control variables
- Instrumental variable approaches
- Sensitivity analyses with different specifications
- Subgroup analyses by ACO characteristics

## Key Findings

### Main Results

Our analysis revealed a complex relationship:

1. **Inverted U-Shape**: ACOs with moderate baseline spending showed the greatest likelihood of achieving savings
   - Very low baseline: Limited room for further reduction
   - Very high baseline: May reflect sicker populations or structural challenges

2. **Regional Variation**: The relationship between baseline spending and savings varied significantly by region
   - Suggests local market factors matter substantially
   - Practice pattern variation affects savings potential

3. **Quality Interaction**: The relationship was stronger among high-quality ACOs
   - Suggests efficiency gains, not quality reduction
   - High-performing ACOs better able to leverage improvement opportunities

### Secondary Findings

- **ACO Size**: Larger ACOs showed more consistent savings across baseline spending levels
- **Rural vs. Urban**: Different patterns emerged in rural versus urban settings
- **Track Selection**: ACOs in different risk-bearing tracks showed different patterns

## Policy Implications

### Benchmarking Methodology

Current MSSP benchmarking uses historical spending trends. Our findings suggest:

- May penalize already-efficient ACOs
- Could reward inefficient baseline performance
- Might need risk adjustment beyond current methods

### Program Design

Implications for program design:

1. **Regional Benchmarks**: Consider region-specific savings targets
2. **Quality Requirements**: Maintain strong quality requirements to prevent savings through reduced care
3. **Glide Paths**: Different expectations for ACOs starting at different efficiency levels

### Health Equity

Important equity considerations:

- ACOs serving disadvantaged populations may face higher baseline costs due to social determinants
- Savings targets should account for population characteristics beyond medical risk
- Program design should not penalize ACOs serving vulnerable populations

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge: Data Granularity

Medicare public use files are aggregated to protect privacy:
- Limited ability to examine patient-level variation
- Restricted geographic detail
- Trade-off between privacy and analytical precision

**Solution**: Combined multiple data sources and used ecological analyses where necessary

### Challenge: Attribution Methodology

Medicare's beneficiary attribution methodology changed over time:
- Affected consistency of year-over-year comparisons
- Required careful handling of attribution changes
- Sensitivity analyses under different attribution rules

### Challenge: Selection Bias

ACOs self-select into the program:
- Organizations expecting to succeed more likely to join
- Compositional changes as ACOs enter and exit
- Survivor bias in multi-year analyses

**Solution**: Multiple robustness checks and transparent reporting of limitations

### Lessons for Healthcare Analytics

1. **Context is Everything**: Statistical associations mean little without understanding the healthcare delivery and payment context

2. **Policy Matters**: Analytical work is most valuable when it informs actual decisions and program design

3. **Transparency**: Clear documentation of methods, limitations, and assumptions builds credibility

4. **Iterate**: Initial findings often raise new questions requiring additional analysis

## Connection to Current Work

The skills developed in this research—healthcare economics, program evaluation, statistical modeling, policy analysis—directly inform current analytics work:

- Understanding payment incentives shapes analytics design
- Program evaluation methods apply to operational initiatives
- Statistical rigor ensures valid conclusions
- Policy awareness guides which questions to ask

## Conclusion

The Medicare Shared Savings Program represents a major shift in how we pay for healthcare. Rigorous analysis of program performance is essential to understanding whether these new models achieve their goals of better care at lower cost.

This project demonstrated that baseline expenditures relate to savings potential in complex, non-linear ways. Effective program design must account for these patterns to avoid unintended consequences and ensure equitable treatment of diverse ACOs.

More broadly, it reinforced the critical role of health services research and analytics in evaluating and refining health policy—using data and statistical methods to make healthcare financing more effective and equitable.
