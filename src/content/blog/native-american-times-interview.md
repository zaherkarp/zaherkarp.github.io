This interview features Lisa Snell, editor and publisher of the Oklahoma-based Native American Times. Snell, a Cherokee Nation citizen and former graphic designer, purchased the publication in 2009 and has since expanded its circulation and online presence.

## On Becoming a Publisher

**When did you decide to purchase the paper?**

Snell explains she viewed it as "an opportunity to do something I'd wanted to do for a long time" without initially considering industry challenges. Coming from a background in graphic design, she brought a unique perspective to the publication's visual identity and reader experience.

## Building Tribal Relationships

**How do you work with tribal leaders?**

She emphasizes the need for open communication, noting: "I'm still relatively new, so most tribal leaders don't know who I am yet." Building trust within the tribal journalism community requires time and consistent, quality reporting that serves the community's interests.

## Editorial Independence

**How does this differ from your previous role?**

Unlike her previous position at the Cherokee Phoenix, Snell states she can "pursue interesting stories from every part of our greater tribal community" without tribal limitations. This editorial freedom allows the Native American Times to cover a broader range of tribal nations and issues across Oklahoma.

## The Power of Individual Stories

**What surprised you about the Winnie Guess profile?**

Snell discovered unexpected depth in interviews, learning "everyone has an interesting story to tell, often more than one story." This realization shaped her approach to community journalism, emphasizing individual narratives alongside broader tribal news.

The lesson extends beyond journalism - every community member has experiences and knowledge worth documenting. By creating space for these stories, tribal publications serve as both news sources and historical archives.

## Cherokee Resilience

**How does tribal history inform your business approach?**

She draws parallels between tribal historical adaptation and her business challenges, emphasizing practical problem-solving across generations. The Cherokee people's ability to adapt while maintaining cultural identity provides a framework for navigating the changing media landscape.

Just as tribal communities have evolved through different economic and political environments, the Native American Times must adapt to digital media while serving its core mission of tribal journalism.

## Growth and Expansion

**What are your plans for the publication?**

Snell serves at least 39 Oklahoma tribes and hopes to eventually afford investigative reporting staff within six months. The expansion reflects growing circulation and advertiser support, but also increased responsibility to serve diverse tribal communities effectively.

Investigative journalism requires significant resources - time, expertise, and financial backing. For smaller tribal publications, building toward this capacity represents a major milestone in serving tribal communities.

## Community-Powered Journalism

**How do you work with volunteers?**

The publication relies on community contributors and volunteers, which Snell considers integral from inception rather than future additions. This community-powered model reflects both practical necessity and philosophical alignment with tribal values of collective effort.

Volunteer contributors bring diverse perspectives and local knowledge that professional journalists might miss. They serve as bridges between the publication and tribal communities, ensuring coverage reflects actual community concerns and interests.

## Lessons for Entrepreneurs

Several themes emerge from Snell's experience:

1. **Pursue opportunities without overthinking obstacles**: Sometimes analysis paralysis prevents worthwhile ventures
2. **Build relationships intentionally**: Trust and credibility take time to establish
3. **Learn from community history**: Past adaptations can inform present challenges
4. **Value community contributions**: Sustainable enterprises often require collective effort
5. **Balance idealism with pragmatism**: Long-term goals require short-term sustainability

Her journey demonstrates that successful entrepreneurship in community-focused media requires balancing business sustainability with mission-driven journalism.
