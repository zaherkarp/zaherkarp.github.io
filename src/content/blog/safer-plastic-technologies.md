This interview features Ron Vigdor, president and co-founder of BornFree, discussing the company's mission to manufacture baby products free from bisphenol A (BPA). The piece explores the challenges in promoting safer plastic alternatives and the broader concerns about chemical safety in consumer products.

## Industry Resistance to Change

Vigdor explains that competitors resisted BPA-free manufacturing due to production costs and the expense of transitioning machinery and materials. The financial burden of switching production methods deterred many manufacturers.

### Economic Barriers

The transition to BPA-free manufacturing required:
- **Retooling production equipment**: Significant capital investment
- **New material suppliers**: Establishing relationships and supply chains
- **Testing and certification**: Ensuring safety and performance
- **Market education**: Convincing retailers and consumers of the need
- **Price competition**: Competing with cheaper BPA-containing alternatives

These costs created strong incentives for manufacturers to maintain status quo and downplay BPA concerns.

## Educational Outreach Campaign

BornFree employed multiple channels to raise awareness, including "internet, print advertisements, as well as a massive PR and Marketing campaign" and public seminars about BPA dangers.

### Communication Strategies

- **Direct consumer education**: Explaining health risks in accessible language
- **Medical professional outreach**: Providing scientific evidence to pediatricians
- **Retail partnerships**: Helping stores understand and communicate benefits
- **Media engagement**: Generating news coverage of BPA issues
- **Public seminars**: Face-to-face education about product safety

This multi-faceted approach recognized that changing industry practices required building consumer demand and public awareness.

## Beyond BPA: Broader Chemical Concerns

When asked if BPA represented only part of the problem, Vigdor confirmed that "other polymers/toxins in plastics...will eventually come to light."

### The Whack-a-Mole Problem

Chemical safety advocacy faces a recurring challenge:
1. Researchers identify health concerns with a specific chemical
2. Public pressure builds for regulation or alternatives
3. Manufacturers substitute a different, less-studied chemical
4. Years later, concerns emerge about the substitute

This pattern suggests need for:
- **Precautionary principle**: Testing safety before widespread use
- **Holistic assessment**: Evaluating entire product formulations
- **Ongoing monitoring**: Continued research on approved chemicals
- **Transparent disclosure**: Clear communication about ingredients

## Health Risks of Plastic Chemicals

The interview notes that "small amounts of BPA and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) may leach into foods" especially in acidic or heated conditions, potentially acting as endocrine disruptors affecting children's development.

### Why Children Face Greater Risks

- **Developmental vulnerability**: Rapid growth amplifies exposure impacts
- **Behavioral patterns**: Hand-to-mouth behavior increases exposure
- **Body weight ratios**: Smaller bodies mean higher dose per pound
- **Longer lifetime exposure**: Earlier exposure extends duration
- **Immature detoxification**: Developing systems less able to process toxins

### Conditions That Increase Leaching

- **Heat**: Microwaving or dishwashing plastic containers
- **Acidity**: Tomato-based foods and acidic beverages
- **Damage**: Scratched or worn plastic surfaces
- **Age**: Older plastics may degrade and release more chemicals
- **Sun exposure**: UV light can break down plastic polymers

## Sustainable Alternatives

Vigdor recommends reusable bottles made from safe plastics or stainless steel as environmentally responsible options.

### Material Comparison

**Stainless Steel**
- Pros: Durable, no chemical leaching, recyclable
- Cons: Heavier, more expensive, can dent

**Safe Plastics (Polypropylene, etc.)**
- Pros: Lightweight, break-resistant, affordable
- Cons: Eventually wear out, recycling challenges

**Glass**
- Pros: Inert, no chemicals, indefinite lifespan
- Cons: Breakable, heavy, safety concerns with children

**Silicone**
- Pros: Flexible, heat-resistant, durable
- Cons: Limited long-term studies, more expensive

## The Regulatory Gap

BornFree's emergence highlighted weaknesses in product safety regulation:

### Regulatory Challenges

- **Chemicals presumed safe**: Testing happens after market introduction
- **Slow response times**: Years between concern identification and regulation
- **Industry influence**: Lobbying delays protective measures
- **Global supply chains**: Difficulty enforcing standards across borders
- **Testing limitations**: Long-term health effects hard to predict

### Market-Based Solutions

Consumer pressure and company initiative sometimes move faster than regulation:
- Companies voluntarily reformulate products
- Retailers establish private standards
- Consumer demand drives innovation
- Transparency builds competitive advantage

## Lessons for Consumers

### Making Safer Choices

1. **Read labels carefully**: Understanding plastic type numbers and what they mean
2. **Avoid heating plastic**: Never microwave food in plastic containers
3. **Replace worn items**: Discard scratched or cloudy plastic bottles
4. **Choose alternatives when possible**: Glass, stainless steel, or safe plastics
5. **Stay informed**: Following developments in chemical safety research

### Supporting Safer Products

- **Vote with dollars**: Purchasing from companies prioritizing safety
- **Demand transparency**: Asking companies about ingredients and testing
- **Spread awareness**: Sharing information with other parents
- **Advocate for regulation**: Supporting stronger safety standards

## The Business Case for Safety

BornFree's success demonstrated that:
- Parents will pay premium prices for safer products
- Transparency builds brand loyalty
- First-mover advantages exist in safety innovation
- Consumer education creates market differentiation
- Values-driven business can be profitable

## Broader Implications

The BPA story illustrates several systemic issues:

### Chemical Safety System Needs Reform

- Moving from reactive to proactive testing
- Requiring manufacturers to prove safety
- Updating regulations as science advances
- Protecting vulnerable populations
- Enabling informed consumer choice

### The Role of Corporate Responsibility

Companies can:
- Exceed minimum regulatory requirements
- Invest in safer alternatives before being forced
- Transparently communicate about ingredients
- Support independent safety research
- Prioritize long-term health over short-term profits

## Looking Forward

While BPA awareness has increased, Vigdor's warning about other plastic toxins remains relevant. The chemical safety challenge extends far beyond any single compound to encompass:

- Thousands of chemicals in commerce
- Limited safety data on most substances
- Complex interactions between chemicals
- Emerging understanding of low-dose effects
- Vulnerable population protection

Addressing these challenges requires:
- Stronger precautionary regulation
- Increased safety research funding
- Greater corporate transparency
- Informed consumer decision-making
- Continued advocacy for protective standards

BornFree's journey from niche startup to mainstream option demonstrates that change is possible when concerned citizens, responsible companies, and scientific evidence align to protect public health.
