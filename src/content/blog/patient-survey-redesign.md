## The Challenge

Patient experience surveys are critical tools for understanding and improving healthcare delivery. However, many surveys suffer from poor design that leads to:

- Low response rates
- Unclear or ambiguous questions
- Data that doesn't capture what really matters to patients
- Results that are difficult to act upon

When the UW Health Patient Relations/Resources department needed to redesign their primary care patient survey, they wanted to ensure the new instrument would be both valid and practical.

## User-Centered Design Approach

Rather than relying solely on expert opinion or adapting existing surveys, we took a user-centered approach:

### Patient Interviews

We conducted in-depth interviews with actual patients to understand:

- What aspects of their care experience were most important to them
- How they interpreted existing survey questions
- What questions they felt were missing
- Where confusion or ambiguity existed in current instruments

### Cognitive Pretesting

One of the most valuable techniques we employed was cognitive pretesting, where we asked patients to:

- Read survey questions aloud
- Explain their interpretation of each question
- Describe their thought process while formulating answers
- Identify any confusing or unclear language

This process revealed surprising gaps between what we thought questions were asking and what patients understood them to mean.

## Key Improvements

The redesign resulted in several important enhancements:

1. **Clearer Language**: Removed medical jargon and ambiguous terms
2. **Better Question Flow**: Organized questions logically based on the patient journey
3. **Actionable Items**: Focused on aspects of care that the organization could actually improve
4. **Reduced Burden**: Shortened the survey while maintaining comprehensive coverage

## Validation Process

Beyond pretesting, we employed rigorous validation methods:

- Face validity assessment with clinical staff
- Content validity review with patient advocacy groups
- Pilot testing with a representative sample
- Statistical analysis of response patterns

## Skills Applied

This project drew on multiple methodological approaches:

- **Qualitative Research**: Semi-structured interviews, thematic analysis
- **Survey Methodology**: Question design, response format optimization
- **Healthcare Domain Knowledge**: Understanding clinical workflows and patient touchpoints
- **Stakeholder Management**: Balancing needs of patients, clinicians, and administrators

## Lessons Learned

The most important lesson from this project was the value of involving end users early and often in the design process. Assumptions that seem obvious to healthcare professionals often don't align with patient perspectives.

Additionally, good survey design requires balancing multiple competing priorities:
- Comprehensiveness vs. brevity
- Specificity vs. generalizability
- Clinical relevance vs. patient priorities

## Impact

The redesigned survey provided UW Health with:

- More reliable and valid patient experience data
- Higher response rates due to reduced burden
- Clearer actionable insights for quality improvement
- Better alignment with patient priorities

This work contributed to the broader field of patient experience measurement and demonstrated the importance of rigorous, user-centered design in healthcare quality initiatives.
