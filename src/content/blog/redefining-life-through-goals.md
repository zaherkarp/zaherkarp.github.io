This interview features Susan Bosak, Chair of the Legacy Project (legacyproject.org), discussing how goal-setting and legacy-building can transform education and address student disengagement.

## Beyond the McMoment

Bosak explains the Legacy Project emerged in 2000 as a response to 21st-century challenges. She describes moving beyond the "McMoment"—a narrow present-focused mindset—toward understanding one's life within broader temporal and generational contexts.

This shift in perspective helps young people see themselves not just as isolated individuals but as parts of larger stories connecting past, present, and future.

## Three Core Programs

The Legacy Project operates through three interconnected initiatives:

### LifeDreams: Exploring Individual Potential

This program helps individuals identify and pursue meaningful goals by:
- Clarifying personal values and aspirations
- Developing practical planning skills
- Building confidence in one's ability to create change
- Connecting daily actions to long-term vision

### Across Generations: Intergenerational Connections

This component examines how:
- Older generations provide wisdom and perspective
- Younger generations bring fresh ideas and energy
- Cross-generational relationships enrich both parties
- Legacy thinking spans beyond individual lifetimes

### Our World: Global Responsibility

This program addresses:
- Environmental stewardship
- Social responsibility
- Global citizenship
- Sustainable decision-making

## The Dreamer Framework

Bosak identifies three dreamer types based on how individuals pursue goals, each with distinct strengths and challenges:

### Creative Dreamers
- **Strength**: Strong belief in possibilities
- **Challenge**: Weak execution and follow-through
- **Development need**: Practical planning and action skills

### Dynamic Dreamers
- **Strength**: Action-oriented and energetic
- **Challenge**: Lack of sustained follow-through
- **Development need**: Persistence and completion strategies

### Practical Dreamers
- **Strength**: Analytical and thoughtful
- **Challenge**: Passive rather than active
- **Development need**: Confidence to take action

Understanding one's dreamer type helps individuals develop complementary skills and find collaborators who balance their weaknesses.

## Educational Relevance

Meaningful goal-setting directly combats student dropout rates by helping young people see school's relevance to their futures. When students can connect current learning to long-term aspirations, engagement increases.

### Why Students Disengage

- **Lack of purpose**: School feels disconnected from real life
- **No clear path**: Can't see how today's work relates to future goals
- **Limited vision**: Don't understand opportunities available to them
- **Absence of meaning**: Learning lacks personal relevance

### How Goal-Setting Helps

- **Creates purpose**: Connects education to personal aspirations
- **Provides direction**: Offers clear reasons for current effort
- **Builds agency**: Demonstrates personal control over future
- **Generates motivation**: Links present actions to desired outcomes

## Research Support

Florida State University research found that "planful competence" predicts stronger adult achievement in education and career outcomes. This competence involves:

- Setting clear goals
- Developing action plans
- Adjusting strategies as needed
- Persisting through obstacles
- Reflecting on progress

These skills can be taught and developed, making them appropriate targets for educational intervention.

## Legacy Thinking in Practice

Legacy thinking asks fundamental questions:
- What do you want to create?
- Who do you want to become?
- How do you want to be remembered?
- What will you leave behind?

For young people, these questions provide:
- **Perspective**: Seeing beyond immediate concerns
- **Motivation**: Understanding why effort matters
- **Direction**: Clarifying what's worth pursuing
- **Connection**: Linking personal choices to broader impact

## Generational Wisdom

Intergenerational programs offer unique benefits:

### For Young People
- Access to life experience and perspective
- Learning from others' successes and mistakes
- Understanding historical and cultural context
- Building meaningful relationships across age groups

### For Older Adults
- Opportunities to share accumulated wisdom
- Staying connected to changing world
- Contributing meaningfully to future generations
- Reframing life experiences as valuable resources

## Practical Applications

Teachers and parents can incorporate legacy thinking by:

1. **Asking different questions**: Moving beyond "What do you want to be?" to "What impact do you want to have?"
2. **Creating connections**: Linking current learning to future possibilities
3. **Encouraging reflection**: Regular consideration of values and goals
4. **Providing models**: Sharing stories of people who built meaningful lives
5. **Celebrating progress**: Recognizing steps toward long-term goals

## Addressing the Dropout Crisis

Student disengagement often reflects lack of purpose rather than inability. By helping students:
- Envision meaningful futures
- Connect education to personal goals
- Develop planning and persistence skills
- See themselves as agents of their own stories

Schools can dramatically improve retention and achievement.

## Beyond Individual Success

Legacy thinking extends beyond personal achievement to include:
- **Community contribution**: How will you improve your community?
- **Environmental stewardship**: What world will you leave?
- **Social justice**: How will you address inequity?
- **Cultural preservation**: What traditions will you maintain or create?

This broader perspective helps young people see success as including but transcending individual accomplishment.

## Conclusion

The Legacy Project demonstrates that meaningful goal-setting combined with legacy thinking can transform education. When students see themselves as authors of significant stories connecting past, present, and future, learning takes on new urgency and relevance.

This approach addresses dropout prevention not through remediation but through inspiration—helping young people discover compelling reasons to engage with education and their own potential.
